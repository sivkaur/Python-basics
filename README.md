**Task 1**    
- Created a function for Stack with 'add' and 'remove' operation
- Created a function for Queue with 'add' and 'remove' operation

**Task 2**
- Created a function addVowelCountColumn
  - It takes the following arguments: input CSV file path, the name of the column in the CSV file for which we need to calculate the vowels, output CSV file path
  - It reads the CSV file and stores the data in the dataframe.
  - Then, it applies the function to the dataframe to count vowels and write the data back to the output file
- Created a function countVowels to count vowels in the string

  **Important** 
  - Please update the csvFilePath according to your file location
  - Update the column name for which you want to count vowels when a call is made to addVowelCountColumn function

**Task 3**
- Created a Streamlit app that allows the user to upload a CSV file with two columns, i.e. 'Name' and 'Age'
